Hi I'm Umair Ahmad having 1 year of experience as a Team Lead at Data Insight, working on HEC’s funded project of deep learning “text extraction from scanned images”. Dedicated graduate having distinction in MS Data Science and BS Computer Sciences. I am passionate about the development and tools in computer vision, NLP, and big data in production. I have hands-on experience in the Pytorch for Object detection (YOLO, RCNN, FPN, UNET), speech-to-text (XLSR transformer), Text Summarization (BERT+GPT transformer), many other Big Data tools PySpark, Kafka, Hadoop and performed data analysis operations for business insights.

I am an expert in communicating ideas from machine learning, statistics, and big data as well as in presenting the data analysis results to technical and non-technical audiences. Within this area, I am particularly interested in big and complex data scenarios which our simple industry resources cannot handle and I am more keen towards understanding models’ intuition instead of just using some block of codes.

I am interested to collaborate on deep learning and big data projects specifically text extraction from scanned images, detection, and segmentation of medical prescriptions.
